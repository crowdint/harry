# Hogger

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dabit/hogger.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dabit/hogger)

VERY lightweight web application framework for Ruby

## Why?

To teach new programmers the basic of MVC without necesarily exposing them to a
big Framework like Rails.

We don't need Ruby on Rails Engineers in the world, we need Ruby Engineers.

While Ruby on Rails allows you to easily forget about the entrails of a web app,
this Framework is about the opposite thing.
